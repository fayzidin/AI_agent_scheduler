# üîß Google OAuth Production Setup for Netlify

## Current Issue
Your Gmail integration is failing because:
1. **Missing authorized domain**: `https://aima.netlify.app` is not in your Google OAuth client
2. **Verification-required scopes**: Some scopes need Google's app verification

## Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Update Google Cloud Console
1. **Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)**
2. **Navigate to APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials**
3. **Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID**: `789393805530-q0aoa150hdd2vnn459mf5sg8geqdrol9`
4. **Click Edit** (pencil icon)
5. **Under "Authorized JavaScript origins", add:**
   ```
   https://aima.netlify.app
   ```
6. **Under "Authorized redirect URIs", add:**
   ```
   https://aima.netlify.app
   https://aima.netlify.app/
   ```
7. **Click Save**
8. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for changes to propagate

### Step 2: Verify Scopes (Already Fixed)
The app now uses only read-only scopes that don't require verification:
- ‚úÖ `gmail.readonly` - Read Gmail emails
- ‚úÖ `userinfo.email` - Get user email
- ‚úÖ `calendar.readonly` - Read calendar events

### Step 3: Test the Fix
1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** after saving Google Console changes
2. **Go to https://aima.netlify.app**
3. **Try connecting Gmail** from the dashboard
4. **Should work without verification errors**

## What Changed
- **Removed verification-required scopes**: `gmail.modify`, `gmail.labels`, `userinfo.profile`, `calendar`, `calendar.events`
- **Added read-only scopes only**: These don't require Google's app verification process
- **Updated OAuth configuration**: Now uses minimal, safe scopes

## Limitations with Read-Only Access
- ‚ùå Cannot mark emails as read
- ‚ùå Cannot star/unstar emails  
- ‚ùå Cannot create calendar events
- ‚úÖ Can read emails and parse content
- ‚úÖ Can get user info
- ‚úÖ Can read calendar for availability
- ‚úÖ Can export calendar files (.ics/.vcs)

## If You Need Full Access Later
To get full Gmail/Calendar access, you'll need to:
1. Submit your app for Google's verification process
2. Provide privacy policy and terms of service
3. Complete security assessment
4. Wait for approval (can take weeks)

For now, read-only access is perfect for:
- ‚úÖ Email parsing and AI analysis
- ‚úÖ Meeting detection
- ‚úÖ Calendar export
- ‚úÖ Contact extraction

## Troubleshooting

**Still getting 403 errors?**
- Wait 10+ minutes after updating Google Console
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try incognito/private browsing mode

**"redirect_uri_mismatch" error?**
- Double-check the domain is exactly: `https://aima.netlify.app`
- No trailing slashes or extra characters
- Case-sensitive match required

**"This app isn't verified" warning?**
- Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Go to AI Meeting Assistant (unsafe)"
- This is normal for development apps
- Users will see this until you get verified

## Production Checklist
- [ ] Added `https://aima.netlify.app` to authorized origins
- [ ] Waited 5-10 minutes for propagation
- [ ] Tested Gmail connection on production site
- [ ] Verified read-only scopes are working
- [ ] Confirmed no verification errors

**üéâ After these changes, your Gmail integration should work perfectly on production!**
