# How to Use the Backup

This project includes a backup of the working state in the `backup_final_phase` directory. This serves as a restore point in case any future changes cause issues.

## When to use the backup

Consider restoring from the backup if:

1. Authentication stops working completely
2. Core functionality breaks after changes
3. You want to revert to a known working state
4. You're experimenting with major architectural changes

## How to restore from backup

### Option 1: Full restore

To completely restore the project to the backed-up state:

```bash
# Remove current source files (keep your .env file!)
rm -rf src public *.json *.js *.ts

# Copy all backup files to project root
cp -r backup_final_phase/* ./

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Partial restore

To restore specific components or files:

```bash
# Example: Restore just the authentication components
cp -r backup_final_phase/src/components/auth ./src/components/

# Example: Restore specific service
cp backup_final_phase/src/services/gmailService.ts ./src/services/
```

## What's working in the backup

The backup includes a fully functional version with:

- Working Gmail and Outlook integration
- Simplified authentication flow that's more reliable
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Improved browser compatibility
- Complete calendar integration
- Email parsing with AI

## Important notes

- The authentication flow has been simplified to avoid COOP (Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy) issues
- Error messages are more user-friendly
- Troubleshooting guides are included for common issues
- The UI provides better guidance for users during the authentication process
