# üîß Microsoft Outlook OAuth Setup Guide

## üö® **Current Error Analysis**

The error `AADSTS70002: The provided request must include a 'client_secret' input parameter` occurs because the Microsoft authentication flow is expecting a client secret, which is not required for public client applications like web apps using MSAL.js.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Quick Fix Steps**

### **Step 1: Create a New Azure App Registration**

1. **Go to Azure Portal:**
   - Visit: https://portal.azure.com/
   - Sign in with your Microsoft account

   - Click on "App registrations" in the results

3. **Create a New Registration:**
   - Click **+ New registration**

   - **Redirect URI**: Web ‚Üí `https://aima.netlify.app` (and add your development URL)
   - Click **Register**

### **Step 2: Configure API Permissions**

1. **In your new app registration:**
   - Go to **API permissions**
   - Click **+ Add a permission**
   - Select **Microsoft Graph**

     - `Mail.Read` (Read user mail)
     - `User.Read` (Read user profile)
     - `Calendars.Read` (Read user calendars)
   - Click **Add permissions**

2. **Grant Admin Consent:**
   - Click **Grant admin consent for [your tenant]** if you have admin rights
   - For personal accounts, users will consent during sign-in

### **Step 3: Configure Authentication**

1. **Go to Authentication:**
   - Click **+ Add a platform**
   - Select **Single-page application (SPA)** (NOT Web)
   - Add these redirect URIs:
     ```
     https://aima.netlify.app
     http://localhost:5173
     https://localhost:5173
     ```
   - Check **Access tokens** and **ID tokens**
   - Click **Configure**

2. **Important: Use SPA Platform Type**
   - The error occurs because you're using the "Web" platform type, which requires a client secret
   - SPA applications don't use client secrets, so this will fix the error

### **Step 4: Get Your Client ID**

1. **From the Overview page:**
   - Copy the **Application (client) ID**
   - This is your `VITE_OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID`

### **Step 5: Update Environment Variables**

VITE_OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID=your-microsoft-client-id
```

- Check that your authority is set to "common" in the code

### **"Access blocked"**
- Check authorized redirect URIs are correct
- Wait 5-10 minutes after saving changes
- Try incognito mode

### **"Popup blocked"**
