# üö® Google OAuth Troubleshooting - Popup Closing Too Quickly

## **Current Issue: Popup Closing Before Authentication Completes**

You're seeing errors like:
```
Gmail OAuth error: _.Lc {message: 'Popup window closed', stack: 'Error: Popup window closed...', type: 'popup_closed'}
```

This happens when the authentication popup closes before you have a chance to complete the sign-in process.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Quick Fix Options**

### **Option 1: Complete Authentication Quickly**

The simplest solution is to complete the authentication process quickly:

1. Make sure you're already signed into your Google account in another tab
2. When the popup appears, click your account immediately
3. Grant the requested permissions promptly
4. The popup should close automatically after successful authentication

### **Option 2: Try a Different Browser**

Some browsers handle the authentication popup better than others:

1. **Chrome** or **Edge** typically work best with Google authentication
2. **Firefox** may work with some settings adjustments
3. **Safari** may have stricter security settings

### **Option 3: Use Incognito/Private Mode**

Sometimes using incognito/private browsing mode can bypass these issues:
1. Open an incognito/private window
2. Navigate to the application
3. Try connecting to Google Calendar again

### **Option 4: Clear Cookies and Site Data**

1. Go to your browser settings
2. Find "Clear browsing data" or similar
3. Clear cookies and site data for Google domains and this application
4. Restart your browser and try again

## üîç **Technical Explanation**

The popup closing issue can happen for several reasons:

1. **Browser Security Features**: Modern browsers implement security features that can interfere with popups
2. **Multiple Google Accounts**: If you have multiple Google accounts, the selection process might time out
3. **Slow Network Connection**: If your connection is slow, the authentication might not complete before timeout
4. **Browser Extensions**: Some extensions can interfere with the authentication process

## üîÑ **Alternative Authentication Methods**

If you continue to experience issues, you can use these alternative methods:

### **Manual Calendar Export**

Instead of connecting Google Calendar directly:
1. Use the "Manual Calendar Export" option
2. Download the .ics file
3. Import it into your calendar manually

### **Use the Google Calendar Web Interface**

1. Copy the meeting details
2. Go directly to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)
3. Create the event manually

## üÜò **Still Having Issues?**

If you're still experiencing problems:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Try using a completely different device
3. Ensure you're not using any browser extensions that might interfere with authentication
4. Make sure you're signed in to only one Google account or select the correct account quickly
