# üö® Google OAuth Troubleshooting - COOP Issues

## **Current Error: Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy Issues**

You're seeing errors like:
```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.closed call.
[GSI_LOGGER-TOKEN_CLIENT]: Set token failed. No access token in response.
Token acquisition failed: interaction_required
```

This is caused by browser security features called Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) that can interfere with Google's authentication popups.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Quick Fix Options**

### **Option 1: Try a Different Browser**

The simplest solution is to try a different browser:

1. **Chrome** or **Edge** typically work best with Google authentication
2. **Firefox** may work with some settings adjustments
3. **Safari** may have stricter security settings

### **Option 2: Disable Strict COOP in Your Browser**

#### For Chrome/Edge:
1. Type `chrome://flags` or `edge://flags` in the address bar
2. Search for "COOP"
3. Set "Strict COOP" to "Disabled"
4. Restart your browser

#### For Firefox:
1. Type `about:config` in the address bar
2. Search for `privacy.window.name.update.enabled`
3. Set it to `false`
4. Restart Firefox

### **Option 3: Use Incognito/Private Mode**

Sometimes using incognito/private browsing mode can bypass these issues:
1. Open an incognito/private window
2. Navigate to the application
3. Try connecting to Google Calendar again

### **Option 4: Clear Cookies and Site Data**

1. Go to your browser settings
2. Find "Clear browsing data" or similar
3. Clear cookies and site data for Google domains and this application
4. Restart your browser and try again

## üîç **Technical Explanation**

Modern browsers implement security features that can interfere with cross-origin communication between windows:

1. **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP)**: Restricts what the opener window can do with a popup window
2. **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP)**: Controls what resources can be loaded
3. **Same-Origin Policy**: Restricts how documents/scripts from one origin interact with resources from another

Google's OAuth flow uses popups and cross-window communication that can be blocked by these security features.

## üîÑ **Alternative Authentication Methods**

If you continue to experience issues, you can use these alternative methods:

### **Manual Calendar Export**

Instead of connecting Google Calendar directly:
1. Use the "Manual Calendar Export" option
2. Download the .ics file
3. Import it into your calendar manually

### **Use the Google Calendar Web Interface**

1. Copy the meeting details
2. Go directly to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)
3. Create the event manually

## üÜò **Still Having Issues?**

If you're still experiencing problems:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Try using a completely different device
3. Ensure you're not using any browser extensions that might interfere with authentication
4. Check if your organization has any security policies that might block OAuth flows

**üîí Note on Security Features:**
These security features exist to protect users from certain types of attacks. While they can sometimes interfere with legitimate functionality, they play an important role in web security. The fixes suggested here are safe for most users, but if you're in a high-security environment, consult with your IT department before changing security settings.
